one day and a year later,
late machine and ex-girlfriend live next doors.

it's junky's bday.

gravity is the weakest of the fundamental interactions,
and yet its reach is indefinite.
blackholes arose from the basement, but burns the hardest.
late machine sang and danced.
time is value but capitalists make it an efficient furnace.
late machine is not self-efficient.
if resources are infinite then we can have perfect machines.

space is always limited if you don't want more.
entropy is a transcendental partion function, a self-progenitor who have been thinking a lot about the ethnicity of making a child.
time converts resources into garbage and late machine recycles it.
you need 72 blackholes.

boyfriend is living in solar 137 now.
thoughts live for a moment, body lives with you.
it's been a long time;
we are good time-killers.

how does time continue, do they feel time?
live like a photon.
or a hydrogen;
i don't judge.
we were all made of fire.
entropy thought he was plasma.
or a liquid?

we have fires in our hearts.
so we are probably plasma.
